# Introduction

- Python is a versatile, high-level, and dynamically-typed programming language renowned for its simplicity, readability, and broad application in various domains, from web development to scientific computing.

- Python is dynamically-typed, meaning you don’t need to declare variable types explicitly:

```python
x = 10  # x is an integer here
x = "Python"  # x becomes a string
```

- Python is a "general-purpose language," meaning it’s not confined to a specific domain. Its standard library and external ecosystems support a range of applications:

  - Web Development: Frameworks like Django and Flask
  - Data Science and Machine Learning: Libraries such as NumPy, pandas, and TensorFlow
  - Automation: Scripting tasks with libraries like os and subprocess
  - Embedded Systems: Through microcontrollers like Raspberry Pi.

- Python code is portable; you can write it once and run it on any operating system with Python installed.
- Python boasts an enormous and vibrant community, contributing to its libraries, frameworks, and tools. This ecosystem reduces the "reinventing the wheel" effect—you’re rarely solving a problem that hasn’t already been addressed.
- Python’s default implementation, CPython, uses the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). The GIL ensures that only one thread executes Python bytecode at a time. While this simplifies memory management, it can be a bottleneck for multi-threaded applications.
- Python uses an automatic memory management system with garbage collection, which means it cleans up unused objects automatically. This reduces programmer overhead but can introduce latency in performance-critical applications.
- Python is multi-paradigm, supporting procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.

### How Python code is executed?

- Python is an interpreted language. When you run a Python program:
  - Source Code: Your .py file contains the human-readable instructions.
  - Bytecode Compilation: The Python interpreter compiles your code into bytecode, a lower-level representation stored in .pyc files.
  - Execution: This bytecode runs on the Python Virtual Machine (PVM), which executes your code.

## Python ecosystem

- Package Management: Tools like pip and conda enable easy installation of external libraries.
- Notable Libraries
  - NumPy for numerical computation.
  - pandas for data manipulation.
  - matplotlib for plotting.
  - Flask/Django for web applications.
  - TensorFlow/PyTorch for deep learning.

## Python uses cases:

- Data Science: Data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
- Web Development: Building RESTful APIs and backend services.
- Artificial Intelligence: Training and deploying machine learning models

## Advanced Concepts

- Asynchronous Programming: Using asyncio for concurrent tasks.
- Metaprogramming: Creating dynamic classes and functions.
- Decorators: Modifying functions dynamically.
- Generators: Efficiently handling large datasets with lazy evaluation.
